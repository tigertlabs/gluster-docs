# GlusterFS Documentation

The documentation contained here is for GlusterFS, a scalable network filesystem
suitable for data-intensive tasks such as cloud storage and media streaming. 
GlusterFS is free and open source software and can utilize common off-the-shelf 
hardware. To learn more, [please see the Gluster project home page](http://www.gluster.org).

**Get Started: Download/Install Guide**  

Since Gluster can be user in different ways and for different tasks, it would be difficult 
to explain everything at once. We recommend that you follow the Quick Start Guide first. By 
utilizing a number of virtual machines, you will create a functional test setup to learn the 
basic concepts with. You will then be much better equipped to read the more detailed
Install Guide.
